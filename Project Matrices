● Introduction to Matrices in Python
● Create an application to visualise the matrices in pixel form

Python doesn't have a built-in type for matrices. However, we can treat a list of a list as a matrix. For example: We can treat this list of a list as a matrix having 2 rows and 3 columns

The data stored in the matrix can be strings, numbers, etc.
In a matrix, data are arranged into rows and columns.
Matrix is an important data structure for mathematical and scientific calculation.

Matrices
A Matrix can be 1 dimensional, two dimensional or more than 2 dimensional structure where numbers are arranged in rows and columns.

1D matrix:
- 1D matrix is basically a single list of numbers.

2D matrix:
2D matrix is basically represented as rows and columns. We can also say matrix as the list of lists.

Ways in which RGB is used:
The RGB color model is used in devices to display colors. The RGB color model is best
suited for illuminated screens, such as TVs, computer displays, laptop displays,
smartphone and tablet screens.
Most trendy way is to use the RGB in lightning like in laptops hardware
Now to display a large range of color on the screen, a large range of rgb colors will be
required. So to store these large ranges of rgb colors the matrix is used. Matrix helps to store these large ranges of rgb colors in a well structured way.

Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python libraries used for data visualization. It is a
library for making 2D plots from data in a matrix. It is used for creating static, graphs
animated, interactive visualizations in Python, and matrix and array plotting.
We will be using matplotlib library of python and concept of matrix plotting for printing a
pokeball on the screen, like this -

MATLAB is a programming platform that allows matrix manipulations, plotting of
functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
